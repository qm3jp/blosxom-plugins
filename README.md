blosxom-plugins
===============

Archive of some plugins I made for [blosxom][1] for a short-lived travel blog in 2010.

Pretty much the first perl code I wrote, as evidenced by my baffled comments regarding syntax &c.

If anybody is actually still using blosxom and finds these helpful, I'm delighted.
